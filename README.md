Getting Data NASA POWER, such as Precipitation in Regional by Single Point approach.

Here, you'll find a versatile codebase for retrieving NASA Power data from regional grids. Our code allows you to customize various parameters, such as time and temporal averages, communities, and specific data parameters like precipitation, temperatures, and more. The regional grid you work with is derived from a single-point approach, making it highly adaptable to your specific research or application needs.

Key Features:

1. Retrieve NASA Power data from regional grids.Utilize a single-point approach for regional grid adaptation.
2. Customize time intervals and temporal averages.
3. Select specific communities of interest (modify data parameters, including precipitation, temperatures, and more).
